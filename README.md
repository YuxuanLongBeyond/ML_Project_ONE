Implementation of basic ML methods: Least squares, logistic regression

Note that fake data is made for temporary test.

To Do List:
1. All the loss functions are coded as indicated in the lectures. This may cause some issues, for instance, the loss has not been averaged.
2. There is no pre-processing of the input data. However, it is needed to succeed in the ranking.
3. Group members need to check all functions if there is any typo.
