# ML_Project_ONE
Implementation of basic ML methods: Least squares, logistic regression

Note that fake data is made for temporary test.

To Do List:
1. All the loss functions are coded as indicated in the lectures. This may cause some issues, for instance, the loss has not been averaged, e.g. logistic regression.
2. More feature engineering is desired.
3. Group members need to check all functions in ''implementation' if there is any typo.
4. More test on hyperparameters. Also test on various methods.
5. Try to deal with hard data type, e.g. B, BC, D.
